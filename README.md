# MACHINE LEARNING
## OBJECTIVE
Predict which party a voter will vote for based on a survey conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables
## SOLUTION 
Performe#d descriptive statistics, EDA, and Feature engineering to build various models such as Linear & Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Naïve Bayes, Ensemble Technique and further concluded on basis of performance
metrics that the Tuned KNN Model seems to be an optimized model with an accuracy score of 96%
