### OBJECTIVE
This project is based on 2 case-studies: Vote Prediction and Text Analysis. The first project is to Predict which party a voter will vote for based on a survey conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables and The second project is based on the analysis of the inaugural U.S.A. Presidential speeches. One has to draw inferences based on the analysis done on these speeches

### ALGORITHMS USED
#### Regression:
• Linear Regression
• Logistic Regression
• Lasso and Ridge Regression (L1 & L2 Regularization)
#### Classification:
• K-Nearest Neighbours
• Naive Bayes
• Decision Tree
#### Clustering:
• K-Means
#### Ensemble:
• Adaptive Boosting 
• Gradient Boosting 
• Bagging (Random Forest)
#### Text Mining
•	Text Mining Analytics
•	Support Vector Machine

### SOLUTION 
Performed descriptive statistics, EDA, and Feature engineering to build various models such as Linear & Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Naïve Bayes, Ensemble Technique and further concluded on basis of performance
metrics that the Tuned KNN Model seems to be an optimized model with an accuracy score of 96%
